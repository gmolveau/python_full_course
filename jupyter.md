# Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are text files that can contain both code and markdown.

They are made of `cells` of two kinds `code` and `text`.

Jupyter notebooks support a lot of languages like `python`, `R`, `julia` etc

You can easily create/edit a jupyter notebook with a vscode extension : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks

Those jupyter notebooks are quite common in the data-science field and for notetaking in class.

Here's a good example of the power of a jupyter notebook :

[San Francisco's Drug Geography](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lmart999/GIS/blob/master/SF_GIS_Crime.ipynb), a GIS analysis of public crime data in SF, by [Lance Martin](https://github.com/lmart999).
