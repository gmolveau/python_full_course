Applying the object paradigm, in a `bank.py` script, define a `bank account` object. This object will have a `balance` and a `holder`. It should be possible to `add` money to the account and `withdraw` money from it. It should also be possible to make a `transfer` between 2 accounts.

After defining the class, make an example by instantiating an account, adding 100 units and withdrawing 30 units, then displaying the final balance.

Then instantiate a second account and transfer 70 units from the first account to the second.

Even if this example isn't "real", beware of errors and extremes.

(be sure to code cleanly, and in English).
