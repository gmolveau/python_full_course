Write a command line python script `sponge_cli.py` with the following usage :

`python3 sponge_cli.py --text <my sentence>`

This script should convert `<my sentence>` to a spongebob version (eg. "military grade encryption" => "MILItARy GrAde EncryptiON") and print it.

To convert the sentence, every letter has a 50% chance of being converted to uppercase.
